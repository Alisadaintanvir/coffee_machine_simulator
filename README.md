[Users can choose from different types of coffee: espresso, latte, or cappuccino.
The program checks if there are sufficient resources (e.g., coffee beans, milk, water) to make the selected coffee.
Users can insert coins to pay for their drink, and the program calculates the total amount inserted.
If the user has inserted enough money, the program dispenses the selected coffee and calculates the change.
The program keeps track of the available resources and the money earned from selling coffees.](#Features)

## Usage
To use the coffee machine program, follow these steps:

Run the program using a Python interpreter.
When prompted, enter the type of coffee you want to order: espresso, latte, or cappuccino.
If the coffee machine has enough resources to make the selected coffee, you will be prompted to insert coins.
Enter the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies you want to insert.
The program will calculate the total amount inserted and check if it is sufficient to pay for the coffee.
If enough money is inserted, the program will dispense the coffee and calculate the change.
Enjoy your coffee!
To turn off the coffee machine, enter "off" when prompted for your coffee choice.

Espresso: A strong coffee brewed by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans. It does not contain milk.
Latte: A coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk.
Cappuccino: A coffee drink made with espresso, steamed milk, and a frothy milk foam topping.
Each coffee option has a different cost associated with it.

## Resources
The coffee machine program keeps track of the following resources:

Coffee beans (in grams)
Milk (in milliliters)
Water (in milliliters)
Money (in dollars)
The initial resource quantities can be configured in the resources dictionary.
